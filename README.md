This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Ruby related to instance variables and methods within loops. The bug is subtle and might not be immediately obvious, but it can lead to unexpected program behavior, especially when dealing with complex or larger applications. Please refer to the bug.rb file for the bug demonstration and bugSolution.rb for the solution. The solution involves using a temporary variable to avoid direct modification of the instance variable within the loop. This repository is intended to help fellow developers learn about this potential pitfall in Ruby programming and provide a clear solution for preventing this error in their own projects.
